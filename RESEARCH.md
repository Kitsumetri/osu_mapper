# Research: osu! patterns, slider shapes, and how to train for them

Notes driven by play-test feedback: the maps are *somewhat* playable and follow
the rhythm, but (a) patterns look like random clusters rather than real osu!
patterns, and (b) sliders are only straight 2-point lines. This doc summarises
the relevant mapping concepts and how each maps to a concrete model change.

## 1. osu!standard pattern vocabulary

Source: [osu! wiki — Mapping techniques](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Mapping_Techniques/Basics),
[Technical maps](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Beatmap/Technical_maps).

- **Streams** — runs of circles, usually ¼-beat apart, at small *consistent*
  spacing. Shapes: straight, curved, zig-zag, "variable" (spacing grows).
- **Jumps** — consecutive objects placed *far* apart (spacing ≫ distance-snap)
  to emphasise the music. Sub-types: spaced streams, "geometry" jumps (squares,
  triangles, stars), back-and-forth, sharp-angle vs wide-angle.
- **Flow** — the cursor-path smoothness between objects. *Flow-aim* = angles
  that continue the motion; *aim/snap* = sharp direction changes. Good maps
  alternate intentionally; random angles feel like clusters (our current issue).
- **Distance snap (DS)** — the editor invariant that *time gap ∝ spatial gap*.
  Most ranked patterns hold DS roughly constant within a section. **This is the
  single biggest thing our model ignores** — it places x/y without coupling
  spacing to the inter-onset time.
- **Tech maps** — dense, irregular slider shapes with rapid SV changes; the
  hardest target, save for later.

### Why our output looks random
The model predicts `cursor_x/y` per frame independently of the *rhythm spacing
rule*. Real mappers derive position from (previous position + flow angle +
DS·beat-gap). With no such structure or conditioning, the network samples
plausible-but-uncorrelated positions → clusters.

## 2. Slider shapes

Source: [osu! file format](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Client/File_formats/osu_(file_format)),
[slider docs](https://llllllllll.github.io/slider/what-is-a-beatmap.html).

Curve types in the `.osu` hit-object: `B` bezier, `C` catmull, `L` linear,
`P` perfect circle. Encoding: `curveType|x1:y1|x2:y2|...,slides,length`.

- **Linear (L)** — 2 points, straight (what we generate now).
- **Perfect circle (P)** — exactly 3 points, arc → semicircles.
- **Bezier (B)** — N control points; degree = N−1. *Most real sliders.*
  Repeated/coincident anchors create sharp "red-anchor" corners → waves,
  S-curves, blankets, and slider-art are all bezier with many points.
- **Catmull (C)** — legacy, passes through points; rare in modern maps.

Our decoder reconstructs only the start + end frame → a straight `L|end`. We
throw away the *body shape* entirely because the signal has no channel for it.

## 3. Concrete model/representation changes

Ordered by effort-to-impact.

### A. Couple position to rhythm (fixes "random clusters") — highest impact
- Add **distance-snap conditioning**: derive a per-section DS scalar from the
  data and feed it (and/or predict spacing as a target), so spacing tracks the
  beat gap. Cheap version: post-process — quantise onsets to the beat grid and
  re-space positions to enforce roughly constant DS per section while preserving
  the model's angles.
- Train a **flow-aware loss / representation**: instead of absolute x/y, model
  Δposition (velocity) and angle between successive objects, which is what flow
  actually is. This makes "continue the motion vs snap" learnable.
- **Rhythm snapping**: snap generated onsets to ¼/⅛ subdivisions of the
  estimated beat grid (we already estimate BPM in `timing.py`). Even as pure
  post-processing this removes the "loose" feel.

### B. Real slider shapes (fixes single-line sliders) — medium
- Add slider-body channels to the signal: e.g. encode the slider path as a few
  **relative control-point offsets** (a fixed K anchors, K≈3–4) plus a curve-type
  flag, sampled at the slider-head frame. Decode → `B|p1|p2|...`.
- Simpler interim win **without retraining**: in the decoder, sample the
  `cursor_x/y` signal *along the slider's held frames* and emit those as bezier
  control points (`B|...`). The cursor channel already moves during the hold, so
  the body shape is partially there — we currently discard it. This alone yields
  curved/multi-direction sliders.

### C. Conditioning for controllable style — medium/large
- Condition the diffusion on **difficulty** (star rating / CS / AR / OD) and a
  coarse **pattern/density token** so the user can ask for "stream-heavy Insane"
  vs "jump map". Star rating + object density are computable from the data.

### D. Scale & capacity — ongoing
- Train on far more than 601 difficulties (31k+ available); dedupe shared audio
  to cut storage. More data + bigger U-Net should sharpen pattern structure.
- EMA weights + cosine LR for cleaner samples.

## 4. Suggested next step (smallest change, biggest felt improvement)

Implement **B-interim** (decode slider body from the existing cursor signal) and
**A-postprocess** (beat-snap onsets + per-section DS normalisation). Both are
*decoder/post-processing only* — no retraining — and directly target the two
play-test complaints. Then move to flow/DS-conditioned training (A) and
control-point slider channels (B) for the real fix.
